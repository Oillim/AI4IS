subject : entex transistion
the purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday
with members from commercial and volume managment concernig the entex account :
effective january 2000 , thu nguyen ( x 37159 ) in the volume managment group ,
will take over the responsibility of allocating the entex contracts . howard
and thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the
account over the next few months . entex will be thu ' s primary account
especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations
process and the contracts .
howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be
available for questions or as a backup , if necessary ( thanks howard for all
your hard work on the account this year ! ) .
in the initial phases of this transistion , i would like to organize an entex
"" account "" team . the team ( members from front office to back office ) would
meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the
scheduling , allocations , settlements , contracts , deals , etc . this hopefully
will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before
the finalization process , but to learn from each other relative to your
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as
well . i would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as i
believe this is a critical part to the success of the entex account .
i will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1 / 2000 .
if anyone has any questions or concerns , please feel free to call me or stop
by . thanks in advance for everyone ' s cooperation . . . . . . . . . . .

53,re : ua 4 - meter 1441 for 11 / 97 - falfurrias,"howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .

( otc - bb : dcpi )
dcpi has developed a revolutionary digital printing technology recognized to be
the solution to variable graphical / color printing processes by industry leaders
such as ibm ( nyse : ibm ) ; xerox ( nyse : xrx ) and siemens ( nyse : si ) whose
products only print in black via laser products . dcpi ' s commercial printing
application hardware / software and printing consumable products are expected to
dominate the printing enhancement market ( $ 5 billion plus + + in 2002 ) over the
next several years . dcpi ' s initial target market of more than 4 , 000 large scale
commercial printing companies of the total of 46 , 000 establishments is expected
to drive revenue growth to the tens of millions within its first few years ,
further providing an ongoing revenue stream from the sales of printing
consumable products for years to come .
special investment alert
digital color print , inc . ( otc bulletin board : dcpi )
current price : $ 1 . 25
shares outstanding : 24 . 6 million
market capitalization : $ 31 million
short term target : $ 3 . 00
12 month target : $ 9 . 00
a few reasons to own dcpi :
digital color print , inc . ( dcpi ) , through it ' s wholly owned subsidiary logical
imaging solutions ( lis ) , is in the business of supplying high - speed digital
printing systems and supplies to the commercial printing industry . the printing
systems are unique in technical concept and application . the systems are totally
digital , designed to mount on existing offset web presses and significantly
improve the functionality of the press , not as a replacement - but as an
enhancement . the printing process is called electron beam imaging ( ebi ) , and
is significantly faster the convention laser printing - the only partially
competing technology .
printing is america ' s third largest manufacturing industry ; employing more than
1 . 2 million people in almost 46 , 000 establishments . the printing industry ,
during 2002 , produced over $ 165 billion of printed products and purchased $ 4 . 5
billion of hardware and $ 7 . 7 billion of consumable products . nyse - listed dover
corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that
there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing
from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable
products per month .
offset presses print all types of documents ; forms , labels , tickets , tags ,
advertisements and direct mail pieces , at production rates of 500
pages - per - minute ( ppm ) to thousands of ppm . however , the printed materials
produced are each identical , as each image printed is the offset inked image
derived from the printing plates that are mounted on the offset press . the great
limitations of the offset process are that each image ( page ) remains identical
unless the printing plates are changed . also the inking of the plates requires
the laborious tasks of mixing the inks for each plate , inking the plates and
then cleaning the press for the next job . if the print job requires variable
information , such as ; name , address , bar codes , dates , prices , this must be
added in a distinctly separate print operation . typically this task is performed
by expensive data processing laser printers , manufactured by either xerox , ibm
or oce ' ( formerly , siemens printing systems ) . the laser printers print only in
black .
lis printing systems are designed to mount directly on most offset web presses
and allow for the printing of any type of data or graphics , without limitation ,
and in line with the offset presses traditional production of a colorful end
product . as a simple example : in the production of an event ticket such as a superbowl
ticket , all fixed or non - variable information , such as the colorful
photo - quality front cover and the stadium rules and disclaimers on the reverse
side of the ticket are produced by plates on an offset press ; identical
information on each ticket . a second printing process is then required to add
the variable information , which includes the section , seat and row numbers ,
price and date of the event . this function can be accomplished , in line , by an
lis provided system .
lis printing systems are entirely digital and are dry toner based , which
precludes the laborious press set - up and clean - up tasks , ink mixing and storage
and the production of printing plates . the pressman simply runs the paper
directly through lis ' s printer and it becomes an integral part of the press and
the starting and stopping of the press and the placement of the digital object
on the page are all under the control of lis proprietary software .
nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses ,
estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a
press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of
consumable products per month . dcpi ' s digitalcolorpress was designed to be
installed on the majority of these presses , extending their life and utility by
providing the printing of computer generated variable data in - line with the
offset printing function . further , the system eliminates the need for preparing
and storing printing plates , and inks and the expensive tasks of setting up a
press for a print run , followed by tearing down after each job , cleaning the
press and setting up for the next print job . dcpi estimates that the majority of
printers will upgrade to color during the first two years of the
digitalcolorpress availability and thousands more commercial printers will
purchase systems through dcpi ' s direct sales force and distribution channel
during the next two years .
dcpi ' s first growth step is to increase consumable inventory to support existing
lis systems , each installation generates about $ 6 , 000 per month in consumable
purchases . secondly , to make lis ' s unique color press available from inventory
and expand the current number of installed sites . thirdly , make the product
offering available to the commercial printing industry . large tasks , but
currently without any perceived competition or technological limitation .
this stock will see major upward movement in the next several weeks . right
now , dcpi is one of the street ' s best kept secrets , but it will not remain that
way for long . this is a unique opportunity to get in while trading levels are
still low . as the company goes forward with its business plan and signs major
new contracts , this stock will move quickly . this is your last chance to invest
before dcpi begins major price appreciation . this stock could reach $ 3 . 50 in the
next five trading days !
